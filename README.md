## Projects
### CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION WITH CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS IN PYTHON
Fraud detection is a major issue for many businesses since they discover these fraudulent actions after suffering significant losses. 
Fraudulent practices occur in every industry. It is not possible to determine whether specific businesses or sectors are affected by these illegal transactions or activities


### Enterprise Document Management System
Document Classification Systems refers to managing and accessing the documents electronically. By classifying text, we are intending to appoint at least one classes or classifications to an archive, making it more straightforward to oversee and sort. Then, at that point, create a list of document types and allocate at least one extraordinary catchphrase or expression that will just show up in that document type.
Domain: Document Classification
- Analyze structured and unstructured data at scale to derive new insights and opportunities. Build - validate predictive models.
- Contribute to internal research and development efforts in cutting edge areas including NLP, 
  graph analytics, and AI.
